```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ   Platform Layer (AppKit)           ‚îÇ  Menu bar, lifecycle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ   Business Logic (Managers)         ‚îÇ  State, quit logic, whitelist
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ   Presentation (SwiftUI)            ‚îÇ  UI components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Key Components:**
- **AppManager**: Manages running applications list via NSWorkspace
- **QuitManager**: Handles quit operations with error recovery
- **WhitelistManager**: Persistent and temporary whitelist with UserDefaults
- **SystemProtection**: Hardcoded protection for critical system apps
- **PreferencesManager**: User settings and preferences

For architecture details, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Security & Privacy

### Permissions

QuitAll requires the following permissions:
- **Accessibility**: To enumerate and quit running applications (NSWorkspace API)

**Note:** QuitAll does NOT:
- Use the Mac App Store Sandbox (required to quit other apps)
- Access the internet or phone home
- Collect any user data or analytics
- Require administrator privileges

### Code Signing & Notarization

QuitAll is:
- ‚úÖ **Signed** with Developer ID (for public releases)
- ‚úÖ **Notarized** by Apple (for Gatekeeper approval)
- ‚úÖ **Hardened Runtime** enabled
- ‚ùå **Not sandboxed** (required to quit other apps)

### Open Source

The entire source code is available for inspection. Build it yourself to verify security.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Why can't I quit Finder or Dock?</b></summary>

Finder, Dock, and other critical system components are permanently protected by QuitAll to prevent system instability. This is a safety feature, not a bug.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Some apps won't quit. What should I do?</b></summary>

Some apps may refuse to quit gracefully (e.g., unsaved work). QuitAll will wait 5 seconds and then offer to force quit. You can also manually quit stubborn apps using Activity Monitor.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does QuitAll work with the Mac App Store?</b></summary>

No. QuitAll cannot be distributed via the Mac App Store because it requires disabling the App Sandbox to quit other applications. This is an Apple limitation, not a QuitAll limitation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does macOS say the app is from an "unidentified developer"?</b></summary>

If you're building from source without signing, you'll see this warning. Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper. Official releases are notarized by Apple.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use QuitAll on macOS 11 or earlier?</b></summary>

QuitAll requires macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later due to Swift/SwiftUI requirements. Earlier versions are not supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I uninstall QuitAll?</b></summary>

Simply drag `QuitAll.app` from your Applications folder to the Trash. QuitAll stores minimal preferences in `~/Library/Preferences/dwr.QuitAll.plist` which you can also delete if desired.
</details>

## Troubleshooting

### "QuitAll.app is damaged and can't be opened"

This is a Gatekeeper quarantine issue. Fix it with:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/QuitAll.app
```

### QuitAll doesn't appear in menu bar

1. Check if LSUIElement is set to `true` in Info.plist
2. Restart your Mac
3. Check Console.app for error messages

### Apps aren't quitting

1. Verify App Sandbox is disabled in Xcode project settings
2. Check that you granted QuitAll permissions in System Preferences
3. Some apps may require force quit (wait 5 seconds)

For more troubleshooting, see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).
